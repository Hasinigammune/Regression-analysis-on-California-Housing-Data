# Regression analysis on California Housing Data

One of the most popular challenges in Kaggle is house price prediction. We have performed regression analysis on California Housing Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

First we have implemented the Gradient Descent method in scratch.

Then we have used the libraries available in Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression and SGD Regression) for the same implementation. 

All the three aprroaches gave us similar outputs.
